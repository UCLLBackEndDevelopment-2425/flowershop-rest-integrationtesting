# Exercise 4

Now run **all** the test methods at once (by clicking on the play button next to the class)

As you can see, now only one test method passes and the other two fail now :-(
- How is this possible?
- Have a look at the method resetData with @AfterEach above it. 
  - What does @AfterEach do? 
  - What should be the added value of this method?
  - Add a correct implementation for it.
  - Re-run **all** test methods again, until they all pass at once!
