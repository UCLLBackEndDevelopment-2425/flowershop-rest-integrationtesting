# Exercise 1

Run **only** the test method `given3Flowers_whenInvokingGetFlower_then3FlowersAreReturned`

As you can see, it fails:
- Why does it fail?
- Implement the code so that the test method doesn't fail anymore.

(As a general aside, Spring cannot translate private fields to JSON. So you always need to have a getter for every field to make the transalation from Java to JSON work!)
